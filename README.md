# Whisper To Input

Whisper To Input, also known by its Mandarin name 輕聲細語輸入法, is an Android keyboard that performs speech-to-text (STT/ASR) with OpenAI Whisper or Google Gemini and inputs the recognized text; Supports English, Chinese, Japanese, etc. and even mixed languages and Taiwanese.

## Fork Information & Acknowledgements

This project is a fork of the original [Whisper To Input](https://github.com/j3soon/whisper-to-input). This version includes the significant addition of support for Google's Gemini API, contributed by **aptdnfapt ([@aptdnfapt](https://github.com/aptdnfapt))**, allowing users to turn voice into text using Gemini models.

## Debugging

All current builds in the [release page](https://github.com/aptdnfapt/whisper-gemini-to-input/releases) are debug builds. To view the logs, enable [USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options), connect your phone to a PC, and use `adb logcat` to view the logs. If you have a local Android Studio install, launch the [ADB tool](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb), otherwise, you may want to consider installing a minimal standalone ADB from [Minimal ADB and Fastboot](https://xdaforums.com/t/tool-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-2-9-18.2317790/).

Below are some useful `adb logcat` commands:

```sh
adb devices
adb logcat *:E
adb logcat *:W
adb logcat *:I
adb logcat *:D
adb logcat *:V
```

See [the adb doc](https://developer.android.com/tools/logcat) for more info.

## Permission Description

## FAQ and Known Issues

-   Sometimes the keyboard will silently fail, please see issue [#17](https://github.com/j3soon/whisper-to-input/issues/17) for further information.
-   Taiwanese (or Hokkien) transcription seems to work quiet well, although [not declared officially](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (thanks [@ijsun](https://github.com/ijsun) for discovering this). To support Taiwanese transcription, do not set the `Language Code` in the settings page.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/j3soon/whisper-to-input/issues) if you have any questions.
